# Crypto-Tracker-Project

Crypto-Tracker is a website that intends to show cryptocurrencies around the world. Every cryptocurrency has information in a newer window, which can be seen in INR and USD format. This project is intended to show how cryptocurrencies are growing in the present market with the help of a graph. This website is accessible free to everyone, making it more relevant than other websites. The project was done by a group of three including me. 
My contribution was development, resource gathering, and making project reports, in this project, I used React JS, HTML, and CSS and for the backend server I used Google Firebase with the help of my team I developed the project and made the project report. In this process, I have learned how website works and respond to the action, how to manage a team and while doing the project I have faced issues by which I learned how to tackle the problem and resolve it
